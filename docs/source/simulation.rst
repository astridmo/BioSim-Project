Simulation and Graphics
========================

Each module consist of  one class.

The module graphics main objective is to give support for visualisation.

The module simulation, is in the highest order in the hierarchy.
Meaning that by utilizing simulation and the class BioSim, BioSim will
initialize both graphics and island (which uses landscape and so on).

Following are documentation for the module *simulation*, and the
supporting module graphics.
